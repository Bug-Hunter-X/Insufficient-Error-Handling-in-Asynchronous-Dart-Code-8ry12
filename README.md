# Insufficient Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart code: insufficient error handling. The example shows how to fetch data from an API, but the error handling is minimal. This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.

The `bug.dart` file contains the code with the issue. The `bugSolution.dart` provides an improved version with more robust error handling.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.dart`. Observe the lack of specific error messages when issues occur.
3. Run `bugSolution.dart` to see an example of better error handling.

## Key Improvements in `bugSolution.dart`

* **Specific Exception Handling:** Instead of a generic `catch (e)`, the improved code includes specific exception handling (e.g., `FormatException` for JSON decoding errors).
* **User-Friendly Error Messages:** Instead of simply printing the exception, the improved code provides more user-friendly error messages.
* **Retry Mechanism (Optional):** The improved code could include a retry mechanism, which attempts the request again after a delay if a temporary network issue occurs.
* **State Management:** In a larger app, the error should ideally be handled within a state management solution (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, BLoC). This ensures the UI reflects the error appropriately.
